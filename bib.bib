   title = {Seq no more: Better Strategies for Parallel Haskell},
   year = {2010},
   abstract = {We present a complete redesign of Evaluation Strategies, a key
abstraction for specifying pure, deterministic parallelism in Haskell.
Our new formulation preserves the compositionality and modularity
benefits of the original, while providing significant new benefits.
First, we introduce an evaluation-order monad to provide clearer, more
generic, and more efficient specification of parallel evaluation.
Secondly, the new formulation resolves a subtle space management issue
with the original strategies, allowing parallelism (sparks) to be
preserved while reclaiming heap associated with superfluous
parallelism.  Related to this, the new formulation provides far better
support for speculative parallelism as the garbage collector now
prunes unneeded speculation.  Finally, the new formulation provides
improved compositionality: we can directly express parallelism
embedded within lazy data structures, producing more compositional
strategies, and our basic strategies are parametric in the
coordination combinator, facilitating a richer set of parallelism
combinators.

We give measurements over a range of benchmarks demonstrating that the
runtime overheads of the new formulation relative to the original are
low, and the new strategies even yield slightly better speedups on
average than the original strategies.

   title = {Intel Concurrent Collections for Haskell},
   year = {2010},
   abstract = {Intel Concurrent Collections (CnC) is a parallel programming
model in which a network of steps (functions) communicate
through message-passing as well as a limited form of shared memory.
This paper describes a new implementation of CnC for Haskell.
Compared to existing parallel programming models for Haskell,
CnC occupies a useful point in the design space: pure and deterministic
like Strategies, but more explicit about granularity and
the structure of the computation, which affords the programmer
greater control over parallel performance. We present results on 4,
32, and 48-core machines demonstrating parallel speedups ranging
between 7X and 22X on non-trivial benchmarks.
