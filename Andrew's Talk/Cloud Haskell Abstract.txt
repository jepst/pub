Title: Haskell for the Cloud

Speaker: Dr Andrew P. Black, Professor of Computer Science at Portland State University

Abstract:

Prof Black will present Cloud Haskell, a domain-specific language for
developing programs for a distributed-memory computing environment, on which
he worked during his recent sabbatical at Microsoft Research, Cambridge. Cloud Haskell is
implemented as a shallow embedding in Haskell; it provides a message-passing
communication model, inspired by Erlang, without introducing incompatibility
with Haskell's established shared-memory concurrency. A key contribution is a
method for serializing function closures for transmission across the network.

Cloud Haskell has been implemented; the talk will include some example code
and some preliminary performance measurements.

This is joint work with Jeff Epstein (Cambridge Computing Lab) and Simon
Peyton Jones (Microsoft).
